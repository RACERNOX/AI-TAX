## **🤖 AI TAX AGENT CODE VERIFICATION**

### **Tax Calculation Logic Review:**
```python
# From tax_calculator.py - calculate_taxes() method
def calculate_taxes(self, tax_data):
    # Extract values
    wages = float(tax_data.get('wages', 0))                    # ✅ $5,207.78
    interest_income = float(tax_data.get('interest_income', 0)) # ✅ $0.00
    other_income = float(tax_data.get('other_income', 0))       # ✅ $0.00
    federal_withholding = float(tax_data.get('federal_withholding', 0)) # ✅ $55.12
    filing_status = tax_data.get('filing_status', 'single').lower()     # ✅ 'single'
    
    # Calculate total income
    total_income = wages + interest_income + other_income       # ✅ $5,207.78
    
    # Get standard deduction
    standard_deduction = self.standard_deductions.get(filing_status, 14600) # ✅ $14,600
    
    # Calculate taxable income  
    taxable_income = max(0, total_income - standard_deduction)  # ✅ max(0, -$9,392.22) = $0.00
    
    # Calculate federal tax owed
    federal_tax = self.calculate_federal_tax(taxable_income)    # ✅ $0.00
    
    # Calculate refund or amount owed
    refund_or_owed = federal_withholding - federal_tax          # ✅ $55.12 - $0.00 = $55.12
```

### **Tax Bracket Logic Verification:**
```python
# From calculate_federal_tax() method
def calculate_federal_tax(self, taxable_income):
    if taxable_income <= 0:     # ✅ $0.00 <= 0 is True
        return 0.0              # ✅ Returns $0.00 - CORRECT
```
